# üëä Problem We're Tackling

Industrial warehouses are facing several challenges in 2025, including increased pressure to scale, rising labor costs, and workload spikes that exceed what humans alone can manage. As a result, many industrial warehouses are beginning to adopt robotic automation to enhance workflow speed and efficiency.

One of the key issues in robotic-powered industrial warehouses is data centralization, especially when operating within a Web2-based infrastructure. This challenge is further compounded by the industry's frequent adoption of distributed manufacturing strategies, which create complex supply chains involving multiple stakeholders and manufacturing units spread across various locations.

In a Web2-based robotic infrastructure, these parties often operate in silos due to disjointed and fragmented data systems, leading to information asymmetry. In other words, a robot system in one warehouse may collect data that is not shared with robots in another warehouse, making it difficult to achieve a unified operational view. The problems that arise from this include:

#### ‚ùå Data is not Transparent: 

Factories and warehouses operating their robotic fleets in an isolated data systems or across various locations, will create a "visibility gap" that limits transparency and access to real-time operational data for stakeholders.
   
#### ‚ùå Low Efficiency + Track and Trace Challenge: 

Workflow efficiency suffers due to the complex data integration processes that slow decision-making and create operational bottlenecks. This lack of transparency also complicates essential tasks like tracking the history of production or the handling of a product, even among connected facilities. The underlying reason is the lack of clear auditing trials which can be easily access, and this is a classic problem in supply chain sector.
   
#### ‚ùå Security Concerns: 

Security concerns are heightened in Web2 environments, where mutable data is vulnerable to tampering and counterfeiting, which is considered a damage to the supply chain and distribution trust. Additionally, the risk of a single point of failure can lead to significant disruptions, cascading through the entire robotic automation operation.
