## üëä Problem We're Tackling

![image 5 (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eafd5fc9-38c3-493a-8c32-934631d3f8d6)

Industrial warehouses are facing several challenges in 2025, including increased pressure to scale, rising labor costs, and workload spikes that exceed what humans alone can manage. As a result, many industrial warehouses are beginning to adopt robotic automation to enhance workflow speed and efficiency.

One of the key issues in robotic-powered industrial warehouses is data centralization, especially when operating within a Web2-based infrastructure. This challenge is further compounded by the industry's frequent adoption of distributed manufacturing strategies, which create complex supply chains involving multiple stakeholders and manufacturing units spread across various locations.

In a Web2-based robotic infrastructure, these parties often operate in silos due to disjointed and fragmented data systems, leading to information asymmetry. In other words, a robot system in one warehouse may collect data that is not shared with robots in another warehouse, making it difficult to achieve a unified operational view. The problems that arise from this include:

#### ‚ùå Data is not Transparent: 

Factories and warehouses operating their robotic fleets in an isolated data systems or across various locations, will create a "visibility gap" that limits transparency and access to real-time operational data for stakeholders.
   
#### ‚ùå Low Efficiency + Track and Trace Challenge: 

Workflow efficiency suffers due to the complex data integration processes that slow decision-making and create operational bottlenecks. This lack of transparency also complicates essential tasks like tracking the history of production or the handling of a product, even among connected facilities. The underlying reason is the lack of clear auditing trials which can be easily access, and this is a classic problem in supply chain sector.
   
#### ‚ùå Security Concerns: 

Security concerns are heightened in Web2 environments, where mutable data is vulnerable to tampering and counterfeiting, which is considered a damage to the supply chain and distribution trust. Additionally, the risk of a single point of failure can lead to significant disruptions, cascading through the entire robotic automation operation.

## üí° Inspirations: Really Motivated Us!

To address the problems, letting current industries robotic setup to transition and utilise an IOTA-connected distributed data system is a smart move. The intuition behind is simple: Every action taken by a robot in a factory is recorded on the blockchain, making product movement, quality checks, and production steps fully transparent, traceable, verifiable, and tamper-resistant, significantly enhancing security and auditability for all supply chain stakeholders. Our team had included this in our demo video, don't miss it!

## ‚öîÔ∏è Existing Solutions and Challenges

Existing solutions for implementing robotic automation in industries include a variety of software platforms (such as Gazebo and Webots), industry-specific solutions (like those from ABB, KUKA, and Fanuc), and integration tools (including ROS, AWS IoT, and Microsoft Azure IoT Hub). However, challenges emerge when considering the implementation of Web3 solutions in robotic automated operations. A significant hurdle is that the IOTA ecosystem lacks robotics-related development tools to facilitate the integration of blockchain solutions with existing legacy systems, which are often incompatible.

>  A simple example: while developing a prototype for our demo, we found that no industry-grade robotic simulators offer tools for easily interacting with IOTA events to conduct simulations.

‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è Although industries can create their own tools or middleware for IOTA integrations, this approach can be costly, time-consuming, and resource-intensive. We need a solution to bridge the gap between industry robotic automation (web2 layer) and the IOTA ecosystem (web3 layer).

Here is a concept illustration:

## üí™ We launch HyperAgile (Our Solution)

Hence, our team decided to launch HyperAgile as the first B2B Middleware-as-a-Service (MaaS) provider,¬†assisting industries across various sectors with industrial warehouse robotic automation by designing and developing a custom hub. This hub acts like a bridge, which connects all components in their robotic automation setup architecture to the¬†IOTA ecosystem. The benefit of using a custom middleware hub is that all of the important layers in the Web2-based robotic automation systems such as the factory floor (physical hardwares and robotics), IoT connectivity layer, security layer and also control and management layer, able to interact with the blockchain layer component easily (which involve on-chain tokenized assets, accounts, modules and packages, or any on-chain tooling integration). Our hub will now become the common interface for industries to connect all robotic components built by different language, framework, hardware, and communication protocol into a unified Web3 system on IOTA. Below is a high-level architecture overview of a custom hub in a industry robotic setup:

### Introduce the concept of Hub - Architecture Overview

### Why custom, not a ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù solution‚ùì

Our role is crucial because industrial robotic architectures are often complex and highly customized. Each industry has unique operational needs, diverse technologies, and specific regulatory requirements, making a one-size-fits-all approach impractical. That's why we offer tailored solutions, enabling industries to integrate IOTA Web3 infrastructure efficiently, which aligns perfectly with our product-market fit. This approach not only saves significant time for indsutries but also reduces costs.

As a B2B (business-to-business) service provider, we are proud to be the first to offer this service on IOTA. In one of our future milestone (have a look in our pitch deck), HyperAgile will also serve as a key driver in introducing a comprehensive ecosystem of industry-specific robotic development tools to the IOTA community as part of our ongoing service journey.
